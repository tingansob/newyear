		<p class="quote-title">Reaching Goals</p>
		<p class="quote-body">“It must be borne in mind that the tragedy of life doesn’t lie in not reaching your goal.  The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach. It isn’t a calamity to die with dreams unfulfilled,  but it is a calamity not to dream. It is not a disaster to be unable to capture your ideal,  but it is a disaster to have no ideal to capture. It is not a disgrace not to reach the stars,  but it is a disgrace to have no stars to reach for. Not failure, but low aim is sin.” </p>
